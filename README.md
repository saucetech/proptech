This project applies data visualization techniques (aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis) to real estate markets in order to determine whether a one-click service to buy-and-rent properties would be a viable service in San Francisco. The analysis shows that the gross rent in all neighborhoods in San Francisco increase year over year at a faster rate than the average sale price per square foot, indicating that the one-click buy-and-rent service may be popular in San Francisco.

## Technologies

This project leverages Python 3.7 with Pandas and hvplot.

## Installation Guide

In order to install the required PyViz packages, run the following command into your terminal:

```
conda install -c pyviz hvplot geoviews
```

Confirm the installation of all the PyViz packages by running the following commands:

```
conda list hvplot
conda list geoviews
```

## Usage

Simply clone the repo and open the san_francisco_housing.ipynb notebook in order to review the analysis. You may also interact with the interactive plot visualizations using the tools in the toolbar.
